#     Use this if you are sending batch transactions and hence need to send multiple emails at one go.

# :bcc - Add an email to bcc to

# :tags - Array of Strings to tag the message with. Stats are
#   accumulated using tags, though we only store the first 100 we see,
#   so this should not be unique or change frequently. Tags should be
#   50 characters or less. Any tags starting with an underscore are
#   reserved for internal use and will cause errors.

# :google_analytics_domains - Array of Strings indicating for which any
#   matching URLs will automatically have Google Analytics parameters appended
#   to their query string automatically.
